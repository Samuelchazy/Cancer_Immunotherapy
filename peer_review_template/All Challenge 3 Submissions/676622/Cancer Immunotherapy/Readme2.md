## 3 parts of Therapy :

## (A) Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy
The first goal is thus to identify the gene (out of all 15,077 possible genes that passed quality control) that when knocked out would lead to the largest proportion of progenitor cells 
cell state proportion vector to be P=(1,0,0,0,0), cell state proportion vector of Pi=(ai,bi,ci,di,ei). the minimum cycling percentage constraint (i.e.,diâ‰¥0.05)


## (B) CAR T-Cell Therapy
define the objective function
the goal is thus to identify the gene (out of all 15,077 possible genes that passed quality control).
The top 20 submissions of Challenge 1 will have their top predicted genes.
each group is scored using the AUC computed similarly as in (A) but using the predicted and experimental rankings obtained based on the objective function used in (B).

## (C) Other Therapeutic Strategies
