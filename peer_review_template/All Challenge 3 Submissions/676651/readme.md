Readme
This repository contains a writeup and code for a scoring function that summarizes the gene expression distribution obtained from knocking out a gene. The writeup provides a detailed explanation of the scoring function and how it is used to evaluate the perturbation of knocking out a gene. The code folder contains an implementation of the scoring function in Python.

Writeup
The writeup can be found in the writeup folder. It provides a complete description of the scoring function, including the formula and how it is used to evaluate the perturbation of knocking out a gene.

Code
The code for the scoring function can be found in the code folder. The implementation is in Python and uses NumPy and scikit-learn to calculate the Mahalanobis distance and cosine similarity. The code provides an example of how the scoring function can be used in practice.
