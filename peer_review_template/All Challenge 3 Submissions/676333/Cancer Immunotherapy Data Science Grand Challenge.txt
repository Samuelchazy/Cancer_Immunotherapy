The Cancer Immunotherapy Data Science Grand Challenge is a competition focused on finding a way to improve the ability of T cells, a key component of the immune system, to fight cancer. The challenge involves exploring and testing numerous genetic modifications or perturbations to T cells in the laboratory, with the goal of identifying the best perturbations that could enhance cancer immunotherapy. The sheer number of possible perturbations and combinations makes it difficult to solve this problem experimentally, hence the competition aims to bring machine learning to this problem to help find the best perturbations.
