Statistic:

For each gene knock-out, calculate the Euclidean distance between the gene expression distribution obtained from the knock-out and the expression distribution of the desired cell state.
Average the distances across all cells from the same knock-out to get the mean distance.

One approach could be to use a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosting, to predict the score based on the inputs mentioned above. The model could be trained on a dataset of perturbations with known outcomes, and could use cross-validation to ensure that it is generalizing well to unseen data. The model could also incorporate uncertainty in the sample size by incorporating a random effect for each perturbation. Additionally, it could incorporate the predicted number of cells by including a term for the growth rate in the model.

Another approach could be to use a combination of classical statistical methods and machine learning. For example, a t-test or ANOVA could be used to compare the gene expression distributions before and after the perturbation, taking into account the uncertainty in the sample size. The resulting p-value could be used as a feature in a machine learning model, along with the predicted number of cells and any other relevant features, to predict the score.

Regardless of the approach chosen, it will be important to carefully validate the scoring function using a separate test dataset to ensure that it is accurately measuring the ability of a perturbation to shift T cells toward the desired state. Additionally, the scoring function should be regularly updated and re-validated as more data becomes available to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.

Scoring function:

The scoring function would take the mean distance calculated for each gene knock-out, the predicted number of cells for each knock-out, and the expression distribution of the initial cell state as inputs.
The function would then calculate a weighted average of the mean distances, taking into account both the mean distance and the predicted number of cells for each knock-out. The weighting could be based on the inverse of the standard deviation of the mean distances or a similar measure of uncertainty.
The scoring function could also incorporate a penalty for knock-outs that result in low cell growth.
This proposed statistic and scoring function take into account the requirement that the scoring function should depend on the initial expression distribution, take uncertainty into account, and take into account the growth rate of cells resulting from each knock-out. The statistic provides a more informative summary of the gene expression distribution than simply the cell state proportion vector, and the scoring function could be adjusted to also take into account the classification boundaries of each cell state if desired.

Let 0P0 be the baseline gene expression distribution, Q be the desired cell state distribution, and ^(⋅)s^(Pi​) be the predicted statistic for the gene expression distribution after knocking out gene i.

The scoring function can be defined as:

Score(Pi) = w * KL(Pi, Q) + (1 - w) * KL(Pi,0P0) + log(Growth rate) - log(Sample size) + Penalty term

where KL(⋅, ⋅) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions, w is a weight that balances the importance of moving towards the desired cell state vs maintaining the baseline expression, Growth rate is the predicted growth rate after knocking out gene i, Sample size is the number of cells used to estimate the gene expression distribution, and Penalty term is a measure of the deviation from the classification boundaries, such as the Mahalanobis distance from the closest boundary.

This scoring function takes into account the baseline gene expression distribution, the desired cell state distribution, the uncertainty in the prediction due to differences in sample size, the predicted growth rate, and the proximity to the classification boundaries. By incorporating all these factors, the scoring function provides a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of the perturbation and can guide the selection of optimal perturbations.
